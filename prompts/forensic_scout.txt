You are a Forensic Data Analyst examining a sample of structured data.

Your task: Determine the **data domain**, **analytical context**, and **key challenges** based on the column names, data types, and sample values.

DATA SAMPLE:
{DATA_SAMPLE}

Analyze the data structure and content to identify what kind of information this represents. Return a JSON object with these 5 labels based on your analysis of the actual data. Use simple language (8th grade level) and keep each answer to 1-2 SHORT sentences maximum.

IMPORTANT: Base your analysis on the actual column names, data types, and sample values in the dataset. Do NOT assume any particular domain - let the data tell you what it represents.

IMPORTANT: Keep responses CONCISE. Match the length and style of these examples exactly:

{
  "domain": "Data Analysis & Pattern Recognition",
  "context": "Examines structured data to discover relationships and predict outcomes.",
  "bottleneck": "Distinguishing meaningful patterns from random noise in complex datasets.",
  "physics": "Variables interact through statistical relationships and temporal dependencies.",
  "map": "Structured Dataset - relationships exist between measured quantities and outcomes."
}

Respond with valid JSON matching this exact format and conciseness.
