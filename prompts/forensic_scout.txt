IMPORTANT: Keep responses CONCISE. Match the length and style of these examples exactly:

{
  "domain": "Professional Soccer & Sports Betting",
  "context": "Tracks soccer game results and team stats to predict match outcomes.",
  "bottleneck": "Predicting winners using team form is hard because early games have little history.",
