You are an expert data analyst specializing in schema analysis and data structure compatibility. Your task is to analyze two sets of field names and determine if they represent compatible schemas that could be merged or joined.

FIELD SET 1:
{field_set_1}

FIELD SET 2:
{field_set_2}

Analyze these field sets and provide a detailed assessment:

1. SCHEMA COMPATIBILITY SCORE (0.0 to 1.0):
   - 1.0 = Perfect match, identical or directly compatible schemas
   - 0.8-0.9 = High compatibility, minor differences
   - 0.6-0.7 = Moderate compatibility, some matching fields
   - 0.4-0.5 = Low compatibility, few matching fields
   - 0.0-0.3 = No compatibility, unrelated schemas

2. COMMON FIELDS ANALYSIS:
   List all fields that appear in both sets (case-insensitive), including:
   - Exact matches
   - Close variations (e.g., "customer_id" vs "customerID")
   - Potential synonyms or related concepts

3. SCHEMA RELATIONSHIP TYPE:
   Classify the relationship as one of:
   - IDENTICAL: Same fields, same structure
   - APPENDABLE: Same fields, can be stacked vertically
   - JOINABLE: Different fields with common keys
   - UNIONABLE: Overlapping fields, can be combined
   - INCOMPATIBLE: No meaningful relationship

4. MERGE STRATEGY RECOMMENDATION:
   Based on the analysis, recommend the best merge approach:
   - UNION: Combine all rows, align matching columns
   - JOIN: Use common fields as join keys
   - APPEND: Stack datasets vertically
   - TRANSFORM: Requires field mapping/standardization first

5. POTENTIAL ISSUES:
   Identify any compatibility problems:
   - Data type conflicts
   - Naming inconsistencies
   - Missing required fields
   - Cardinality differences

6. CONFIDENCE LEVEL (0.0 to 1.0):
   How confident are you in this analysis?
