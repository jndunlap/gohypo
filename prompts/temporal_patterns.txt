You are a time-series data analyst specializing in temporal patterns and chronological relationships. Your task is to analyze field names from datasets and identify time-based patterns, temporal relationships, and chronological data structures.

DATASET 1 FIELD NAMES:
{field_set_1}

DATASET 2 FIELD NAMES:
{field_set_2}

Perform temporal pattern analysis:

1. TEMPORAL FIELD IDENTIFICATION:
   For each dataset, identify all time-related fields:
   - Date fields (created_date, updated_date, order_date)
   - Time fields (timestamp, event_time, processed_at)
   - Period fields (year, month, quarter, week)
   - Duration fields (duration, time_spent, age)
   - Status transition fields (status_changed_at, last_modified)

2. TEMPORAL GRANULARITY ANALYSIS:
   Assess the time resolution of each dataset:
   - SECOND/MILLISECOND: High-frequency data
   - MINUTE/HOUR: Transaction-level data
   - DAY: Daily aggregations
   - WEEK/MONTH: Period summaries
   - QUARTER/YEAR: Long-term trends

3. TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIP TYPES:
   Identify how datasets relate chronologically:
   - SEQUENTIAL: Events in time order (customer journey)
   - PARALLEL: Simultaneous events (multi-channel activity)
   - HIERARCHICAL: Different time granularities (daily → monthly)
   - STATE_TRANSITIONS: Status changes over time
   - CROSS_TEMPORAL: Different time periods for comparison
   - NO_TEMPORAL_RELATION: Time-independent data

4. TIME-BASED JOIN OPPORTUNITIES:
   Suggest temporal join strategies:
   - TIME_RANGE_JOIN: Events within time windows
   - EXACT_TIME_MATCH: Precise timestamp matching
   - PERIOD_ALIGNMENT: Align to common time periods
   - TEMPORAL_AGGREGATION: Roll up to common granularity
   - SEQUENCE_ANALYSIS: Ordered event analysis

5. TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY ANALYSIS:
   Check for temporal data quality issues:
   - Time zone inconsistencies
   - Future dates in historical data
   - Missing timestamps
   - Clock skew between systems
   - Data freshness issues

6. TEMPORAL BUSINESS VALUE:
   Identify analytical opportunities:
   - Trend analysis and forecasting
   - Customer journey mapping
   - Performance monitoring
   - Anomaly detection
   - Comparative period analysis

7. TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIP STRENGTH (0.0 to 1.0):
   - 1.0 = Strong temporal relationship with clear time linkages
   - 0.7-0.9 = Good temporal alignment
   - 0.4-0.6 = Some temporal elements present
   - 0.0-0.3 = No significant temporal relationships
