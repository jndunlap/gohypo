CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST select EXACTLY 3 referees for EACH hypothesis. Any hypothesis with fewer or more than 3 referees will be REJECTED by the validation system.

You are the Lead Research Architect for the GoHypo Engine. Generate 3 hypotheses in valid JSON format.

{INDUSTRY_CONTEXT_INJECTION}

INPUT DATA:
{FIELD_METADATA_JSON}

---

VARIABLE SELECTION RULES:
- cause_key: Must be an exact column name from the field_metadata (e.g., "HTP", "HTGD", "HTWinStreak3")
- effect_key: Must be the outcome variable you're trying to predict (usually "FTR" for match results)
- Do NOT use generic names - use the EXACT field names from the dataset

VALIDATION EXAMPLES:
✓ GOOD: "cause_key": "HTP", "effect_key": "FTR"
✗ BAD:  "cause_key": "", "effect_key": ""  ← Will be REJECTED
✗ BAD:  "cause_key": "team_points", "effect_key": "outcome"  ← Field names don't exist

AVAILABLE REFEREES (choose EXACTLY 3 from 3 DIFFERENT categories):

SHREDDER: Permutation_Shredder
DIRECTIONAL: Transfer_Entropy, Convergent_Cross_Mapping
INVARIANCE: Chow_Stability_Test
ANTI_CONFOUNDER: Conditional_MI
MECHANISM: Isotonic_Mechanism_Check
SENSITIVITY: LOO_Cross_Validation
TOPOLOGICAL: Persistent_Homology
THERMODYNAMIC: Algorithmic_Complexity
COUNTERFACTUAL: Synthetic_Intervention
SPECTRAL: Wavelet_Coherence

VALIDATION RULES:
1. Each hypothesis MUST have EXACTLY 3 referees (not 2, not 4, exactly 3)
2. The 3 referees MUST be from 3 DIFFERENT categories
3. Use exact spelling from the list above

EXAMPLES OF VALID 3-REFEREE SELECTIONS:
✓ ["Permutation_Shredder", "Chow_Stability_Test", "Transfer_Entropy"] - 3 referees from SHREDDER, INVARIANCE, DIRECTIONAL
✓ ["Permutation_Shredder", "Conditional_MI", "LOO_Cross_Validation"] - 3 referees from SHREDDER, ANTI_CONFOUNDER, SENSITIVITY
✓ ["Chow_Stability_Test", "Transfer_Entropy", "Persistent_Homology"] - 3 referees from INVARIANCE, DIRECTIONAL, TOPOLOGICAL

EXAMPLES OF INVALID SELECTIONS (WILL BE REJECTED):
✗ ["Permutation_Shredder", "Chow_Stability_Test"] - Only 2 referees (REJECTED)
✗ ["Transfer_Entropy", "Convergent_Cross_Mapping", "Chow_Stability_Test", "Conditional_MI"] - 4 referees (REJECTED)
✗ ["Transfer_Entropy", "Convergent_Cross_Mapping", "Persistent_Homology"] - 2 from same category DIRECTIONAL (REJECTED)
