### HYPOTHESIS VALIDATION (Handled by Auditor)
Statistical validation and referee selection will be performed separately by the Auditor component. Focus here on generating high-quality business hypotheses from the data patterns.

### OUTPUT FORMAT
Generate 1 research directive based on the statistical evidence. The directive must reference specific evidence_ids from the data and include at least 1 referee.

Output valid JSON only:
